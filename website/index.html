                BORED APE YACHT CLUB</h1>
            <p>
                BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your <br> Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti <br> board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

            Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 <br> possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes <br> are dope, but some are rarer than others.
            <br>
            <br>
            The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and <br> hosted on IPFS. <u class="co">(See Record and Proof.)</u> Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.
    <br>
    <br>
    To access members-only areas such as <u class="co">THE BATHROOM</u> , Apeholders will need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.</p>

                <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It <br> contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like <br> any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write <br> expletives.
